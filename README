codepad.el --- Emacs integration for codepad.org

See http://codepad.org

Codepad is a pastebin where you can paste code and share it on a chat or via email. Codepad also provides an online compiler/interpreter and can run your programs online.

emacs-codepad provides an Emacs integration for Codepad. Currently you can use it to paste your code online. But I hope to expand it in the future (see TODO section in codepad.el)

Contributors are welcome!
